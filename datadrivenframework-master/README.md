# DataDrivenFramework
New Data driven framework Approach for New Beginner .


Data Driven Framework is one of the popular Automation Testing Framework in the current market. 


Data Driven automated testing is a method in which the test data set is created in the excel sheet, 
and is then imported into automation testing tools to feed to the software under test.

Selenium Webdriver is a great tool to automate web-based applications. 
But it does not support read and write operations on excel files.

Therefore, we use third party APIs like Apache POI.

APACHE POI

Apache POI (Poor Obfuscation Implementation) is an API written in Java to support read and write operations â€“ modifying office files. This is the most common API used for Selenium data driven tests.


There are several ways to implement a Data Driven Framework, and each differs in the effort required to develop the framework and maintenance.

Developing Data Driven framework in Selenium using POI helps reduce maintenance, improve test coverage thus providing a good return on investment.
